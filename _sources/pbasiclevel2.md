Basic Python, Level II is a two week course. We continue our development of basic programming concepts by introducing collections, iteration, and branching. 




- **Collections** We introduce the four types of basic collections in Python: sets, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Most of our focus in this course will be lists.

- **Iteration** Repeating the same block of code multiple times is called iteration. We introduce three main patterns of iteration in basic Python.


- **Branching** Branching statements are used to change the normal flow of execution based on some condition. We introduce branching as a standard technique for controlling the flow of execution.




**Prerequisites:** Basic Python, Level I
