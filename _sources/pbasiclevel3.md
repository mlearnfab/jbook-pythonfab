Basic Python, Level III is a two week course. We continue our study of Python by focusing on three topics:

- **Functions:** We will learn how to write our own functions as well as understand how functions are incorporated in Python modules.

- **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries were introduced in Basic Python, Level I as a type of collection. We look at dictionaries in depth. 

- **String Methods:** In Basic Python, Level I we introduced ``string`` as a basic data type for character data. We examine how to manipulate characters and text using string methods.

**Prerequisites:** Basic Python, Level II
